The Nativo Admin interface was my primary project during the last half of my time at Nativo. It is a web appliction that serves as the primary user interface for all of Nativo's ad platform. It encomposses all sorts of features, but the most important having to do with creating campaigns, and setting where and when ads are served.

The admin is a very large application and certain teams were assigned to certain feature sets. I was on the insights team which handled performance analytics and brand ranking functionality. This meant that my primary workload usually revolved around building out the endpoints that served data for various dashboard and chart UIs. Sometimes I would also be responsible for building the client side components as well.

I really enjoyed working on this project. I got to do a lot of fancy stuff with SQL building out ETLs and complex views which aggregated a ton of data from disparate tables. This part of the business always felt like it was on the cutting edge of what we were doing as a company and I enjoyed the freedom to explore new ideas that brought with it.
