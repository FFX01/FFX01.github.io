Title: About

My name is Justin Walters. I'm a professional software engineer with over a decade of experience. Most of my professional career has consisted of working on full stack web applications.

This is my blog. I write mostly about tech topics, such as industry news, projects I've worked on, and any interesting ideas I might have. Occasionally I write about my hobbies as well.
