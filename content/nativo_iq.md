Nativo IQ is the first project I was assigned to during my 6 years at Nativo. It's primary purpose was as a branded content analytics platform. Originally, the application was designed to be made directly available to our clients, but later in its life, it became an internal tool.

Nativo IQ had a lot of interesting features, most I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about in depth.

Here are the basics:

- Content management and analytics dashboard
- Content discovery UI
- Integrated web scraping
- Integration with Nativo's Javascript SDK for engagement tracking
- Internally available RESTful JSON API
- Content Categorization and analysis

Core Technologies used for this project:

- Python
- Django
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- elasticsearch
- Snowflake
- Redis
- Vue
